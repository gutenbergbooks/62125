<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pleasures of social intercourse are amongst
the best and truest enjoyments in which we
can participate—the desire for the friendship of
others is more or less inherent in human nature.
There are nevertheless thousands upon thousands
who are surrounded by every opportunity for
realising these pleasures, and who yet fail to benefit
by their influence, either for temporary and
healthy pastime, or for permanent good. Most
people have doubtless many amongst their circle
of acquaintance who are easily distinguished from
others by the term ‘unsociable.’ It would, however,
be both unfair and incorrect to estimate that a
large proportion of a given number of people have
a decided objection to and shun all society. The
habitually unsociable people are frequently those
who would readily confess to a liking for society,
but who do not enter into it on account of the
various and numerous obstacles which, they will
tell you, are in the way. It is not so much on
account of an innate and acknowledged indisposition
for social intercourse that the saying,
‘Some folk are as unsociable as milestones,’ is proverbially
correct, as that many barriers have been
erected by the suspicious imaginations of those
concerned. People are often heard to complain
of the unsociability of others; but it is not unseldom
that the very people who adopt this standpoint
are those who, at the least approach from
others, retire almost entirely within their insignificant
individuality, and assume a reserve of
manner and constrained mode of conversation,
that of itself forbids any attempt to cultivate
their acquaintance. Something like a hedgehog
which, should you happen to catch sight of it,
instead of making friends, rolls itself up into
a ball, and shews off its bristles to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing constitutes so great a hindrance
to what may be termed natural and unadulterated
social intercourse as the unnatural appearance
which many folk strive to put upon themselves
and their belongings for the benefit of the objects
of their acquaintance. For the entertainment of
their visitors, some good folk will change, as far
as they possibly can, the entire face and features
of their houses and themselves—in short, for the
time being they seem to be somebody else—they
go to great pains to make things unreal. On such
show-occasions a profusion of apologies is sometimes
showered upon the unhappy and disappointed
guests; they are begged to excuse the
unceremonious and very ordinary preparation
made for their reception and entertainment;
whilst it is apparent that every available resource
has been utilised to make an imposing appearance.
It was, we think, John Wesley, who having been
invited out to dine, was asked, soon after his
arrival at the house of the host, to excuse the
fact that no preparation had been made. ‘Then,’
replied he rather sharply, ‘there ought to have
been;’ and without waiting to see whether there
was reason for such an apology, left the house
forthwith.</p>

<p>Feelings of rivalry and jealousy, and the existence
of an ultra spirit of caste, are responsible for
much of the unsociability which prevails. Mr
and Mrs Jones do not fraternise with Mr and Mrs
Smith, who may live next door, because they, Mr
and Mrs Jones, have concluded that they have
ascended two or three more rounds of the ladder
of social status. It is quite probable, moreover,
that Mr and Mrs Smith may be duly impressed
with precisely the same sense of superiority. Mr
Jenkins does not wish to be patronised, and therefore
cares not to cultivate the acquaintance of Mr
Jones. Mr Jones having a paramount consciousness
of his pre-eminence, would deem it undignified
to be friendly with Mr Jenkins. Thus
people sit in judgment upon themselves and other
people, and form what they deem a sound opinion
as to the disposition of others without ever having
had the smallest opportunity of arriving at an
accurate estimate. Imagination, hearsay, and the
impressions derived from mere appearance at first
sight, are often the sole materials employed in
producing what is intended to pass as a detailed
character-photograph. The estimates thus formed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>{98}</span>
are frequently circulated as genuine and reliable
in every particular; and yet there may be as much
difference between such estimates and the truth, as
between a genuine and a base coin of the realm.
The estimate which may be given you by one man
of another is only reliable in so far as he is capable
and has had the opportunities of forming an <i>accurate</i>
judgment.</p>

<p>As the tenor of a man’s life will to some extent
be the reflection of his associations, it is essential
that some discrimination be employed. But a
man may be sociable and yet avoid careless promiscuous
friendships. By the same rule that you
cannot touch pitch without being defiled, neither
can you have the friendship of sensible men and
true, without profit. Nor need a sociable man
eschew the duties and comforts of home-life. The
association with friends, at home, may be made to
take the place of association with mere acquaintances,
sometimes of a questionable sort, abroad; and
hence home may be made more homely.</p>

<p>The plea is sometimes advanced, ‘Oh, we cannot
afford to have company.’ Here is where a great
mistake is made. Surely we should not measure
the value of our friendships on the basis of a knife-and-fork
calculation! The friendship which is
measured by the amount of money expended on it
is surely worth little. It is not so much the good
dinner society which we would advocate, as the
propagation of simple and genuine friendships.
Formal parties and dinings-out are by reason of
modern usages acknowledged to be for the most
part dreary affairs, both for the givers and the
guests. Dinners got up for display, arranged with
an object, invitations given for sundry reasons—to
the man, for instance, whose only qualification a
guest may be his ability to be a source of entertainment;
or to the titled gentleman and lady
whose style and title shall grace the list in the
newspaper columns. This amongst the upper ten
thousand may be perhaps regarded as a necessary
evil. Such state ceremonies have become fashionable
amongst what has come to be popularly
designated the <i>élite</i> of society.</p>

<p>We especially refer, however, to the sociable traits
of the great middle class, amongst whom a large
dinner-party scheme is neither practicable nor
desirable, but to whom the more frequent exchange
of civilities with their neighbours would be
a boon. But the way is frequently barred by the
comparisons which are made. The ladies are generally
desirous that the furniture of their houses
should not compare unfavourably with that in the
houses of those with whom they may be intimate.
A source of the greatest concern is it if they
have not Brussels carpet as good and as new as
that of their neighbours. Then their furniture it
may be is in green rep, that of their friends in
crimson plush. Further anxieties are created as
to plate, the size, style, and number of servants,
and a dozen other considerations of a kindred
sort. This everlasting contest to keep up appearances
is at once the bane of our tempers and our
pockets. It is the main thing on which the
unreality of our time is fed, and upon which it
thrives so well. Whatever may be the real
impediment to sociability, we ourselves, while
fostering the evil, uncharitably and inconsistently
plead that the unsociable tendency exists more in
others than ourselves!</p>

<p>Were there an utter absence of opportunity for
benefiting by the society of others, the fact would
be deemed a hardship and a misfortune; and yet
there are plenty of individuals who live in crowded
cities but are the most lonely of beings. Not only
are they never seen to speak to others, but apparently
never even see them; the social faculties
are thus rarely called into play, and are left to rust
out. What do such men lose as the result of this
isolation? Their knowledge of the best side of
human nature is at a low ebb; while on the other
hand the association with and knowledge of those
around us teach us not only to misjudge others
less, but to know ourselves better; and hence there
comes a development and expansion of our sympathies.
More freedom of intercourse must tend not
only to increase our pleasures but to alleviate our
troubles, for as we see that others have their ‘ups’
and ‘downs,’ we learn to look upon our own as
less burdensome. The man who neither sees,
hears, nor participates in anything beyond his
own immediate surroundings, can know little or
nothing beyond the narrow boundary of his own
individuality—a very circumscribed sphere to
live and work in, certainly. People often need
friends who, under given circumstances, will afford
the benefit of their own experience. The person
whose only acquaintance is himself, complains of
the hardness of his lot, and whilst estimating what
difference he imagines the cultivation of friendships
would make to his pockets, fails to estimate
what he would gain by the sympathy and good-will
of others, and how his dreary path would be
brightened by less isolation.</p>

<p>There is, however, an inborn craving in most
people for society of some kind, though occasionally
it is sought for in directions which are not
beneficial in their tendency; and this, we fear, is
the result of the swarm of conventionalities which,
for the most part, surround the social life of our
day, some healthy counteraction of which—especially
in the interests of the young—would be
welcome.</p>

<p>Happily the habits of isolation and unsociability
are more prevalent in some places than
in others. Those who have travelled most will
readily admit that they have frequently found
themselves amongst a circle of individuals whose
freedom from conventionalities, and whose unconstrained
and hearty mode of intercourse, made
them forget for the time being that they were
in the company of strangers. It is possible that
some readers of these words may almost shudder
at the idea of such freedom, such a want of
decorum on the part of people who had never met
before, and had not gone through the formality
of a proper introduction. And yet there may be
decorum without painful fastidiousness. Who has
not met with unsociable railway travellers, some
in whose company he has been for many weary
hours, and with whom he may have succeeded,
after supreme effort, in breaking the ice, only to
receive a solitary monosyllable in response! Such
an experience is certainly not the rule, for sometimes
we meet with those, the incessant wag of
whose tongue may be such as to compel us to
leave unread both our newspaper and any favourite
book that we may have promised ourself to get
through. And yet it is well on such occasions to
go on the principle of give and take. Anything
rather than the company of an individual who
looks suspiciously at you should you be venturesome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>{99}</span>
enough to express to him an opinion on so
commonplace a topic as the state of the weather.</p>

<p>As a valuable element in connection with our
social life, music does not occupy the position
which it might and ought to do. The rapid
growth during recent years of a knowledge of
this charming solace is out of all proportion to the
extent of its social enjoyment. It is unfortunately
too often treated as a mere accomplishment. The
friendly and informal musical parties such as were
enjoyed years ago, do not receive much encouragement.
It is of course indisputable that as a concert-giving
power, rapid strides have been made in
music; but what we contend for is the propagation
of home harmony; the social glee, the favourite
ballad, the instrumental quartette, with no objection
to an occasional sonata for the pianoforte.</p>

<p>It is no less amusing than disagreeable to see
so many otherwise worthy people possessed of such
a paramount sense of gentility and importance as
to make themselves and their surroundings uncomfortable,
and often miserable. The great desideratum
is that people should appear more like themselves
than somebody else. We hear and read a
good many sermons on ‘Morality;’ but, excellent
in their way as these are, a series of lectures on
‘Reality’ are quite as necessary.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.—SIR SYKES’S WARD.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> may be pleasanter positions in life than
that of a dependant, especially when the claim
to make one of the household rests on conditions
which it is impossible to define. The governess,
who is so often held up by moralists as an object
for our conventional pity, needs not, surely, to
forfeit her self-respect, inasmuch as she earns
her salary and its contingent benefits by honest
labour. The companion too gives valuable consideration
in the shape of a perpetual offering up
of her own time, tastes, and wishes, for her pay
and maintenance. There are others sometimes
however, kindred strangers within the rich man’s
gates, who have no ostensible tasks to perform,
who cannot give monthly or quarterly notice and
go away, and yet whose bread is sometimes made
very bitter to them—white slaves who get no
compassion from the world at large.</p>

<p>Miss Willis at Carbery Chase was oddly situated.
An orphan, she found herself domiciled
amongst those who were allied to her neither by
blood nor by the still more tenacious tie of
common and early associations. She was exempt
of course under that roof from many of the
annoyances which fall to the lot of the motherless
elsewhere. There was no domineering mistress
of the house to resent every attention shewn to
the interloper as something deducted from the
rightful due of her own matchless girls; no
niggard to grudge her every meal of which she
partook at the stinted family table; or tyrant to
pile upon her submissive shoulders the never-ending
load of petty cares, which some genteel
drudges perform unthanked.</p>

<p>At Carbery there was plenty and to spare. Sir
Sykes was a gentleman bland and courteous; the
girls as kind good girls as could easily be met
with; and the servants sufficiently well trained to
take their cue from their employers, and to be
civil to one who was smiled on by the higher
powers. Yet a sensitive young lady in the
position which Sir Sykes’s ward now occupied,
might well have been excused if her heart at times
was somewhat heavy. All her old habits of life
had been in a moment uprooted. She had been
suddenly transferred from familiar scenes and
people whose ways she understood, to a country
every feature of which must have been strange
and new to her. Under the circumstances and in
spite of the good-nature of those around her, it is
not surprising if Ruth Willis at times looked sad
and pensive.</p>

<p>‘You cannot think how wonderful it seemed to
me at first,’ she said one day to the younger Miss
Denzil, ‘not to hear the drums beat tattoo at sundown,
or how often I have started from my pillow
in the early morning, fancying that I heard again
the bugles sounding for the parade. Then the
trumpeting of the elephants beside the tank, and
the shrill voices of the dusky children at play
beneath the peepul trees, and all the sights and
sounds about my old home in India—I can’t
forget them yet.’</p>

<p>Blanche was sympathetic; but she felt rather
than reasoned that the grief for a father’s loss, the
regrets for friends abruptly quitted and a mode of
life abandoned, could not be assuaged merely by a
kiss and a kind word. Yet it was evident that
Ruth was by no means disposed to play the part of
a kill-joy in the house beneath whose roof she
was now established, or to enact the martyr. Her
manner was very soft and gentle, not obtrusively
sad or unduly deferential, but that of one who
sincerely wishes to please. She had a way of
bending her will as it were to that of those with
whom she now associated, which was really very
pretty and graceful, and harmonised well with
the modest drooping of her eyelids when she spoke.
There were times (so her ill-wishers said, the latter
being some of those vigilant critics who take our
wage and wear our livery, or it may be caps and
aprons and cotton prints such as we sanction, but
who are not always too lenient censors of our conduct)
when her whole face seemed to change its
expression by the mere opening of the fine dark
eyes fraught with a singular look, which the same
critics averred to be that of ill-temper. But if
Miss Willis had not, as Lucy and Blanche Denzil
believed her to have, the temper of a lamb, it
must be admitted that she was capable of very
great self-restraint, since in general conversation
she was only too ready to acquiesce with the
opinions of others. Jasper had observed the
singular brightening of Ruth’s eyes sometimes,
when she turned them on Sir Sykes, but never
towards himself; while his unsuspecting sisters
saw no peculiarity in the bearing of the stranger
whom they had learned to like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>{100}</span></p>

<p>‘I could really believe,’ said Jasper to himself
more than once, ‘that my father is afraid of that
girl—and no wonder after all!’ he added, after
a moment’s reflection. Certainly Sir Sykes did
appear somewhat over-anxious that his ward should
be happy and comfortable at Carbery, that her
tastes should be studied, and her inclinations consulted.
Yet he never seemed at ease in her company,
and always escaped from her presence as
early as politeness permitted; so that his own
daughters set down his behaviour as merely
prompted by an over-strained sense of hospitality.</p>

<p>There was a fascination in the guest’s bearing
and conversation, to which even Jasper, with all
his predisposition to dislike her, could not but
succumb. No great talker, Miss Willis had the
power, somehow, of making what she did say
more effective than what fell from other lips than
hers. What this art or this gift might be, Jasper
Denzil, who was no stranger to women and their
ways, could not divine. The girl’s voice was rich
though low, and admirably modulated, although
of music, as she frankly confessed, she knew
nothing whatever. And her eyes—the one redeeming
feature of a plain pale face—could flash and
glitter with wondrously changing play of light;
eyes and voice and words all blending together
to convey the expression which their owner
desired that they should impart.</p>

<p>There was one person to whom the baronet’s
ward appeared in the light of an enigma, and this
was Lord Harrogate, himself a frequent visitor at
the home of the Denzils, between whose family
and his own there was indeed some kind of connection.
He had given up as preposterous the
idea that he had ever seen Miss Willis before.
<i>That</i> was of course erroneous, and he must have
been the dupe of a fancied resemblance. But he
was sufficiently quick-sighted to perceive, what
was apparent neither to his sisters nor to Jasper,
nor to the Earl or Countess, that a strong sharply
marked character was concealed behind the gentle
half-bashful demeanour which it pleased Miss
Willis to assume.</p>

<p>‘I never saw the iron hand,’ he thought to himself,
‘so well hidden before by the velvet glove;
but it’s there for all that. Yonder girl looks capable
of turning the whole family round her finger.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jasper at anyrate had other subjects
for contemplation than were presented by a
psychological study of the orphaned daughter of
the late Major Willis, of the Honourable East
India Company’s Service. Gentlemen who own
and gentlemen who are going to ride horses
intended to win a race which had so suddenly
swelled into importance as the forthcoming one at
Pebworth, have need of frequent communication
with one another. Jasper during the next ten
days was often in his principal’s company, sometimes
at Pebworth, now and then at Exeter, when
the routine of military duty held the other
captain to his post.</p>

<p>In the interim, Captain Denzil could tell by
the language of the newspapers which were the
accredited organs of the turf, how considerable
was the excitement evoked by the selection of
Pebworth as a place where might be matched
against one another some of the finest weight-carriers
chronicled in the Stud Book. The wildest
rumours were afloat, and an April sky was not
more changeable than were the odds, as reported
from the headquarters of gambling, London and
Liverpool. Sometimes the bookmakers were reported
to be assured of triumph; sometimes it
was hinted that the great betting firms would be
severely hit, so unexpected would be the finish of
the race.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ indignantly demanded one influential
paper, ‘should Pebworth be dragged into the
daylight?’ Nor were the other organs of the
sporting press slow to swell the chorus of complaint
that a cramped and hitherto unheard-of
course, situated in an obscure nook of the far
west, should be the arena for a struggle such as was
anticipated. And then followed dark innuendos
and vague suggestions as to the motives of the noble
lord who owned The Smasher, and the scarcely
less illustrious commoner to whom Brother to
Highflyer appertained. During the period preceding
the race, the most contradictory rumours
were incessantly published with reference to the
rival favourites. They were ill; they were well;
they had met with all the accidents slight or
serious to which the equine genus is liable. One
of these important animals had a cough. The
other was not quite sound of limb. Both had
been overtrained. No. Their training was insufficient,
and any nameless outsider could reach
the winning-post before them. Once again both
horses were in the very perfection of bloom and
beauty, and would compete fairly for the prize.</p>

<p>Strange faces, some of which were not calculated
to inspire confidence in those who had silver
spoons in the pantry or linen drying on garden-hedge,
began to appear at Pebworth and the
parts adjacent. Lodgings were in such request
that the meanest rooms were eagerly disputed at
fancy prices, while inn and beershop drove a
brisker trade than had been known since Pebworth
had been disfranchised.</p>

<p>‘Sad business, Denzil, this!’ exclaimed Jack
Podgers as he dashed into the private parlour of the
<i>De Vere Arms</i>. ‘Here’s a private telegram, and
here a special edition of a sporting paper. Both
agree as to the facts.’</p>

<p>Jasper glanced at the telegram and at the paragraph.
Yes. A most unfortunate accident, due
to the carelessness of a porter, had occurred to
Brother to Highflyer, just as that noble horse
was being led from his box to the platform. Mr
Splint, the eminent veterinary surgeon, summoned
in hot haste, had examined the off fore-leg, and had
expressed a positive opinion; in deference to which
Mr John Knavesmire the trainer and Mr Wylie
the owner had reluctantly decided to withdraw
the name of Brother to Highflyer from the list.</p>

<p>‘The race naturally must be won by the other
favourite, The Smasher,’ said Captain Prodgers
with a grim smile.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.—WHAT HAPPENED AT PEBWORTH.</h3>

<p>From early morning the usually sleepy streets
of quiet Pebworth had been disturbed by the
shouts of bawling hoarse-voiced vendors of so-called
‘correct’ cards, purporting to furnish accurate
information as to the names, weights, and
colours of the riders, the nomenclature and
ownership of the horses, and other particulars
relating to the forthcoming race. Some of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>{101}</span>
itinerants were in faded red jackets that had felt
the dust and the rain on every race-course in
Great Britain; others were in tattered fustian,
stained by the wet grass of the moorside, where
the foot-sore wretches had been sleeping for a few
hours after their weary tramp across country.
It might have been opined that gold had been
discovered in Dartmoor, and that diggers were
hurrying up like so many eagles to the prey,
so many were the uncouth groups that flocked in.
Some of the pilgrims were the veriest human
vermin that cumber the earth. There was the
thimble-rigger, whose stock-in-trade consisted of
the tiny board or slender table, which his unacknowledged
associate is carrying now, with the
peas and the thimble in his pocket. There were
the proprietors of the roulette boards, and the
manipulators of the ‘three card trick,’ so dangerous
to unwary youth. There were gipsy fortune-tellers,
dark-eyed, yellow-kerchiefed, and long-haired
gipsy men, laden with sticks to be pelted
at cocoa-nuts propped on an ash-wand, or at Aunt
Sally with her time-honoured pipe.</p>

<p>All the beggars, street-singers, and sellers of
toys or gingerbread in the west of England seemed
to have been drawn to Pebworth as steel filings
are attracted to a magnet; and with them arrived
many a scowling ruffian in baggy slop-suit, or
slinking fellow in greasy garments of threadbare
black, whose object could hardly have been the
wish to witness a contest of strength and speed
between two or more gallant horses. Probably the
man in black was one of those miserable beings
who bet with chance customers, and if they lose,
pay in person if not in purse, braving kicks,
ducking, and ill-usage, in hopes of five or ten
ill-got sovereigns. As for the sturdier brute in
nailed boots and velveteen, with the knotted
bludgeon beneath his arm, it will go hard with
him if some half-tipsy owner of a watch be not
lightened of it before bedtime.</p>

<p>In poured gigs and carts and carriages of every
size and kind, some full of honest holiday-makers,
others of thoughtful devotees of the Mammon
that presides over the great green gaming-table
that we know by the name of a race-course.
Among the last-mentioned, who in turf phraseology
are termed ‘bookmakers,’ were many, often of
gentle birth and nurture, whose feverish life for
ten months of the year was one of incessant locomotion,
calculation, care, and toil. Some men,
sufficiently well educated to see themselves as
others see them, yet work harder at the dubious
profession they have selected, than does a prosperous
doctor or barrister of many briefs—ever
on the railroad or in telegraph office, scrambling for
make-shift lodgings, suing at the doors of crowded
hotels—chilled by the rain of Newmarket, broiled
by the sun of Chantilly—and incessantly on the
wing to some new race-meeting, goaded on by the
<i>ignis-fatuus</i> of Hope.</p>

<p>The carriages were drawn up three deep around
the judge’s chair and the stand. Small as the
race-course of Pebworth was, it presented a gay
and animated appearance. There were the well-appointed
drags of every regiment within reach
of the little Devonshire town, while the equipages
of the county aristocracy were there in unusual
numbers. There were the Fulfords, the Carews,
the Trelawneys, and the Tresyllians, the Courtenays,
and the Penruddocks, all the rural dignitaries
of the district. The Earl of Wolverhampton
was there with two of his daughters, accompanied
by Blanche Denzil, who was confident of her
brother’s success. Lord Harrogate too was there
on horseback.</p>

<p>No carriage from Carbery was on the Pebworth
course that day. Sir Sykes had heard with displeasure
that his son was about to take a part
in a steeplechase. Jasper’s promise, however, had
been given. His name was in print as the
rider of Norah Creina, and the baronet saw no
help for it. He refused, however, to attend the
race with the ladies of his family, and gave but
a reluctant consent to his younger daughter’s petition
to be allowed to accompany Lady Maud and
Lady Gladys to the festive scene. The course
itself presented a lively and not uncomely scene,
the brilliant beauty of the day adding a witchery
to the homeliest objects. The dancing sunbeams
gilded the tinker’s squalid tent and the rags of
the beggar-boys who ran, clamorous for halfpence,
after the horsemen cantering by. It was possible
to forget the gathering of bookmakers and betting-men,
now hoarsely shouting out their offers of a
wager, possible to ignore the sordid greed that
had prompted the attendance of so many, and to
imagine what the scene may have been two hundred
years ago, when races were a novelty, a mere
trial of merit between swift and strong horses,
minus the thousand and one degrading ingredients
which now compose the saturnalia.</p>

<p>Jasper, his gay silken jacket concealed by the
loose white overcoat which he wore, elbowed his
way through the crowd towards the place where,
hard by the weighing-stand, the nineteen horses
which were the practical residuum of the sixty-seven
entries were being led to and fro.</p>

<p>‘Have a care there! Do mind his heels!’ exclaimed
the reedy voice of an attenuated being in
drab gaiters and striped waistcoat, one of the three
body-servants in attendance on the magnificent
Smasher, as that superb animal began to lash out
furiously amongst the mob.</p>

<p>‘Grand horse that!’ said Captain Prodgers, as
with impartial admiration he surveyed the formidable
favourite. ‘See! what muscles those are
that swell beneath a skin as bright and supple as
a lady’s satin! Does “My Lord” credit.’</p>

<p>‘My Lord,’ a vacuous young gentleman in a suit
of black and white checks and a soft hat, stood a
little way off, sucking the gold head of a short
whipstock, and contemplating society in general,
through his eyeglass, with a serene stare. Nobody
could ever be quite certain whether this aristocratic
patron of the turf was unfathomably deep or
absurdly shallow. His Lordship was a man of few
words, and never committed himself in public to
an opinion wise or foolish.</p>

<p>That ‘My Lord’s’ stud had a knack of winning
was notorious. But then the laurels, such as they
were, may have been due to the florid, well-shaven,
middle-aged trainer, with a flower in his buttonhole,
who stood at his Lordship’s elbow.</p>

<p>The Smasher was a splendid black horse, over
sixteen hands high, and very powerful. His glossy
coat shone like a looking-glass; but that his
temper was none of the best was evident, not only
by the frequent scattering of the crowd, to avoid
his iron-shod heels, but by the sidelong glance of
his wicked eye and the irritable lashing of his
silken tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>{102}</span></p>

<p>‘Shews the whites of them eyes of his, he do,
this morning,’ remarked one appreciative groom.</p>

<p>‘Bless ye! the captain won’t care,’ was the
phlegmatic reply.</p>

<p>‘Rather the captain had the riding of him then
nor me,’ returned the other.</p>

<p>The captain in question was not Jasper Denzil.
It was Captain Hanger, pale and unimpassioned as
ever, who now pressed up to speak for a moment
with the owner and trainer of the horse he was to
ride. As he stood, tapping his bright boots with
his heavy whip, his gaudy silk jacket peeping from
beneath the loose overcoat, he was the object of an
inquisitive admiration that might well have been
spent upon a worthier object. In certain circles,
now, your gentleman steeplechase rider receives
an amount of adulation singularly disproportioned
to his utility to the commonweal. Of the well-known
Captain Hanger, once in the army, then
beggared, and now living by the deliberate risk of
neck and bones, it was popularly believed that he
would die in the exercise of his profession.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see the mare!’ said Jasper, looking
around.</p>

<p>‘We’re keeping her quiet till the last minute,’
whispered his friend. ‘No use in letting her chafe
here, teased by sun and flies. There, though,
is the bell for saddling; and here she comes.’</p>

<p>And as Captain Prodgers spoke, a Homeric
burst of laughter from the mob, peal upon peal,
announced that something had tickled the fancy
of the populace. That something was soon seen
to be no other than Norah Creina, looking even
uglier, as she was led into the inclosure, than she
had done in the stable; a lengthy, clumsy, ungainly
creature to look upon, and wearing a bridle of a
peculiar and cumbrous construction, fitted with a
muzzle and blinkers, and somewhat similar to that
employed in horse-taming by the late Professor
Rarey.</p>

<p>‘There’s a beauty for you!’ cried out, in the
midst of ironical cheers and merriment, a scoffer
in drab gaiters.</p>

<p>‘Take care of her, gentlemen—she bites!’
bawled another voice; and there was tittering
among the spectators in carriages and unrestrained
guffaws amidst the populace.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean, seriously, that the mare is to
run in that hideous-looking contrivance?’ demanded
Jasper sharply and with displeasure in
his face, of his ally. ‘I’m not a mountebank, I
suppose, that I should be made publicly ridiculous
on the back of such a horse. A man might as
well stand in the pillory as’——</p>

<p>‘How many hundreds will be in your pocket,
Denzil, and thousands in mine, what with bets
and stakes, if Norah Creina comes in first?’ interrupted
Prodgers earnestly. ‘Let those laugh that
win. They are waiting for us yonder in the
weighing-stand.’</p>

<p>Of all the candidates for success who, seated in
their saddles, took one by one their turn at the
scales, the only two who attracted much attention
were Jasper Denzil and Captain Hanger; the
latter because he was to ride the favourite, the
former because he had consented to exhibit himself
on so very extraordinary an animal as Norah
Creina.</p>

<p>‘I’ve known a dark horse to win a race,’
remarked one veteran, as he booked a trifling
wager on the Irish mare.</p>

<p>‘Not with a muzzle though, George!’ replied a
contemporary, with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>The riders were all mounted now, and taking,
some of them, the preliminary canter that is
supposed to dissipate stiffness, and then the
glistening line of gaily attired horsemen marshalled
itself for the start. To the last moment
Captain Prodgers, on foot, kept close to Jasper’s
stirrup. ‘There’s the bell!’ cried Norah Creina’s
owner at last. ‘Now bend your ear down, dear
boy, and mark what I say.’</p>

<p>And as Jasper stooped his head to listen, the
other captain whispered to him cautiously but
with emphasis. ‘Only if you’re hard pressed—but
she may win without that,’ added Prodgers
more loudly.</p>

<p>Jasper’s suddenly compressed lips, arching
brows, and dilated eyes told that the communication
had taken even him by surprise.</p>

<p>‘The curb-rein, eh?’ he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>‘Yes; but only as a last expedient. Leave it
slack as long as you can, and use the snaffle only;
it’s as strong as a cable,’ called out Prodgers; and
Jasper nodded, and cantered up to take his place
among the rest.</p>

<p>A waving to and fro of the many-coloured line,
the dropping of a flag, a roar from the rabble,
and they were off. It was like the effect produced
by some gigantic rocket bursting into a galaxy of
variously tinted spangles, pink, green, blue, and
orange. Then most of these colours seemed to
gather themselves together in a group, while
Jasper’s yellow jacket and black cap, and Captain
Hanger’s cherry colour and white, crept clear of
the crowd.</p>

<p>‘The Smasher’s third!’</p>

<p>‘He’s second now. Green’s in front.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! the captain’s a deal too wise to be first,
so long as Green will make running for him.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but look at the ugly long-backed Irish
mare! The Smasher can’t shake her off, straight
as he goes.’</p>

<p>The leading horses had got by this time over
two-thirds of the course—the first round only—and
already the competitors were reduced to seven.
Gallant Green was yet in front, riding hard, but
his horse was much distressed; and as the second
circuit of the course began, The Smasher, skilfully
handled by Captain Hanger, shot past him
with no apparent effort, and was for the moment
first.</p>

<p>‘My Lord’s usual luck! The race is safe!’</p>

<p>‘Cherry and white wins!’ shouted hundreds.</p>

<p>But then uprose another roar of, ‘Yellow,
Yellow for ever!’ as the Irish mare, which had
hitherto kept the third place, taking fence, wall,
brook, and rail with lamb-like docility, suddenly
quickened her pace, racing neck to neck, head to
head, with the redoubtable Smasher.</p>

<p>‘A pretty race! A fine sight! A sheet would
cover both of them!’ was the general cry. The
ladies in the carriages and on the stand waved
their handkerchiefs enthusiastically, and of the
lookers-on there were scores who forgot that their
money was at stake, in genuine enjoyment of the
struggle. On the rivals went. Together they
flew across the brook, together they crashed
through the hedges and fences in their way.
Then, thanks to his own skill or to the excellence
of his horse, Captain Hanger gained ground, and
was in front as he prepared to ride at a stiff line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>{103}</span>
of rails, the last serious obstacle, save one, to be
encountered in the circuit.</p>

<p>Then it was that Jasper tightened the curb-rein
that he had hitherto left untouched, and the disfiguring
blinkers dropped as if by magic from
before Nora Creina’s eyes! The result was startling.
With a snort and a scream, the fierce mare
caught sight of her opponent in the act of gathering
himself together for the leap; and with a
bound such as a tigress might have given, she
hurled herself upon him, striving—but owing to
the muzzle, ineffectually—to tear the other horse
with her teeth. There was a crashing of splintered
timber, an outcry, a heavy fall, and both horses
and both men were down amidst the wreck of the
fence.</p>

<p>Jasper, bareheaded and dizzy, was the first to
stagger to his feet and regain his saddle. A
hundred yards in front was the stone wall with
its double ditch, the so-called ‘sensation jump’
of the race, and which the Committee had taken
it upon themselves to heighten for this exceptional
contest. Beyond, there was the easy run home
over smooth turf to the winning-post.</p>

<p>‘Yellow! yellow! Yellow wins!’ shouted the
crowd, as Jasper approached the wall; but then
there was a quick thunder of hurrying hoofs upon
the green-sward, and Captain Hanger swept past
at whirlwind speed, while cries of ‘Cherry and
white! The Smasher’s first!’ rent the air. Till
that instant, the Irish mare had been going
steadily; but now, on seeing her rival outstrip
her rapid pace, her fiendish temper again kindled
into flame, and with a shrill scream she darted
forward. But Captain Hanger knew his art too
well to be surprised for the second time. He had
his own horse, sobered by the late fall, well in
hand; whereas he saw that the savage animal
which Jasper rode was completely freed from the
control of her rider. By a quick and masterly
motion of the rein, he wheeled off, eluding the
shock that threatened him, and with a rare
courage and coolness put The Smasher’s head
straight for the wall. The gallant horse rose like
a bird, topped the obstacle on which his hind-feet
clattered, and recovering himself with an effort,
galloped in, the winner, amid the deafening
applause of thousands.</p>

<p>Jasper was less fortunate. Panting, snorting
with rage, in a lather of heat and foam, the furious
mare he rode rose at the wall, struck it with her
chest, breaking down the new masonry, and rolled
over upon the turf beyond, bearing down beneath
her weight the unfortunate rider. ‘A man killed!’
It needed but that cry to make the mob utterly
ungovernable; and in spite of the efforts of the
police, gentle and simple, and those who were
neither the one nor the other, hurried pell-mell
to the spot where lay, beneath the broken wall,
the hapless form of Jasper Denzil. ‘He’s alive!’
cried fifty voices, with the oddest mingling of
gratification and disappointment. ‘The rider’s
living. It’s only the mare that’s dead,’ a verdict
which turned out to be correct. Then a doctor,
one out of the half-dozen of doctors on the course,
jumped off the cob he rode and took possession
of Jasper.</p>

<p>‘He’ll get over it!’ cried the surgeon, feeling
first the heart and then the wrist of the sufferer.
‘If we had but a carriage now, to get him quietly
to the inn.’</p>

<p>Sir Gruntley Pigbury, whose barouche stood
near, willingly lent it for such a purpose; and in
it Jasper Denzil, under the doctor’s escort, was
duly removed to the shelter of the <i>De Vere Arms</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OUR_PET_RAT">OUR PET RAT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> obliging correspondent writes to us as follows:
An article in the September number of <i>Chambers’s
Journal</i> entitled ‘Poppet’s Pranks’ having afforded
much amusement to our young people, it has
occurred to me that a short account of one of our
numerous pets might not be unacceptable, especially
as we have often said in our own circle, that
‘Billy’s doings ought to be immortalised in print.’</p>

<p>We have always considered it an important
element in the education of children that they
should be taught to regard the brute creation with
kindly feelings, and in our own family we have
fostered the love of animals by encouraging them
to keep pets; so at various periods, dogs, cats,
birds, rabbits, guinea-pigs, &amp;c. have all in turn
been domiciled with us; and I believe we also
harboured for a time a hedgehog and a bat; but
these last proving rather intractable, were soon
restored to their native freedom.</p>

<p>Those who have had experience in it, best
know how interesting any living intelligence
becomes, when one is brought closely in contact
with it; and we elders, as well as the more
juvenile members of our family, have found both
pleasure and instruction in observing the habits
and dispositions of the little creatures to whom
we gave a kindly shelter. Among these, none
ever excited more interest or stood higher in the
family regards, than Billy our tame <i>rat</i>.</p>

<p>It was in the winter of 1874–5 that a friend who
was coming to spend Christmas with us, brought
Billy as a new treasure for the children; and for
some months he afforded us great amusement. He
arrived in a cigar-box in which he usually slept,
and on its being opened, he sprang instantly inside
our friend’s waistcoat, from which safe retreat he
ventured to peep out at the strange faces, which
he seemed to regard with terror; and this habit he
retained, for although he soon established friendly
relations with us, he always darted behind the
piano or sideboard on the entrance of a stranger;
yet his little head with its bright bead-like eyes
was sure to peep out presently, as if he wanted to
satisfy his own curiosity without being himself
observed.</p>

<p>But here let me say, no one must suppose for an
instant that Billy resembled the repulsive-looking
rat of our farm-yards and ditches. He was of a
much smaller size, not larger than a kitten of a
month old, and very prettily spotted in brown and
white; his eyes were very prominent, standing out
like large black beads, and he was particularly
nice in his toilet, washing just as a cat does, and
keeping his coat always scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>Yet I confess it was some time before I could
regard him with equanimity: it was so hard to
divest one’s self of the general prejudice against his
race; and his receding under jaw gave an uncomfortable
impression at first; so I used to shrink
from him and gather up my skirts at his approach,
although my son declared that if he had been
introduced to me as a ‘rodent,’ I should have
had no objection to him, and that it was merely
the name of ‘rat’ which excited my aversion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>{104}</span></p>

<p>However, be this as it may, Billy soon won his
way to favour in spite of prejudice, and by his
intelligence and good temper made himself a
general favourite. He especially attached himself
to my eldest daughter, and would come at the
call of ‘Billy, Billy!’ from any of his hiding-places,
except at night, when he seemed to be quite aware
that he was wanted to go to bed (in the cigar-box
before mentioned); and then it was often with
great difficulty she could entice him from his
lurking-place. Sometimes she would tempt him
with a biscuit, and he would dart out, snatch it
from her fingers, and dart again behind the sideboard
before she could get hold of him.</p>

<p>We did not usually see much of him in the
morning, as he liked to conceal himself behind the
heavy furniture. But at dinner-time he was sure
to appear, and generally placed himself on my
knee, where from time to time he was fed with
small bits of bread and vegetables; and if I was not
sufficiently attentive to his wants, he would pass
over to one of the children’s plates, and watching
his opportunity, would make a seizure, and dart
with the stolen morsel to his storing-place; and
this habit of storing was very curious, being
evidently an instinct belonging to very different
surroundings. In a room appropriated chiefly to
the children there was an old sofa a good deal
the worse for wear, as what sofa would not be
that had been carriage, omnibus, or railway train
to seven or eight youngsters successively? Under
the pillow, the haircloth had given way, so Billy
found a hole conveniently ready for him, and lost
no time in appropriating it. Thither he carried
many of his stores; and it was most amusing to
watch him nibble a biscuit just like a squirrel,
sitting back on his haunches and holding it neatly
between his fore-paws; and then when he had had
enough for immediate wants, he would spring with
the remainder to this hole in the old sofa.</p>

<p>But it was not only food he stored; he had a
decided fancy for bright colours; and if bits of
ribbon or coloured silk were left in his way, he
would drag them along the floor, and then leap to
the sofa with such celerity that it was almost
impossible to deprive him of his booty. Once I
looked up in time to see and seize one end of
a blue necktie as Billy disappeared with the
other behind the sofa pillow. He came up
directly to see what detained it, and was very
unwilling to give it up; so he pulled and I
held, until finding that I was the stronger, he
relinquished it, but with such impatient little
squeaks! Yet neither then nor at any other time
did he ever attempt to bite or shew any ill-temper
towards any of us; though, like most pets, he had
to bear a fair amount of well-meant teasing, which
no kitten would have stood as well.</p>

<p>I recollect one day watching him with much
interest. He had found on the floor a large newspaper,
which he seized by one corner and pulled
towards the sofa, up which he made several vain
attempts to leap with the paper in his mouth. He
then dropped it, and jumped back and forwards
several times, as if he was measuring his distance,
or making calculations with an eye to future success.
Then again catching hold of the paper, he
tried to leap with it, but again he failed; so at last
I took pity upon him, and tore one half of the
paper away, when he was able to manage the
remainder, and carry it off in triumph to his den.</p>

<p>During the winter evenings, when the children
were engaged with their lessons, Billy was usually
to be found on the table rummaging among their
books and catching at their pens; which latter
amusement he enjoyed very much after the
manner of a kitten running after a knitting-needle
drawn quickly up and down the table; but
as these amusements rather interfered with the
studies, Billy would occasionally be dismissed to
the kitchen, to which he had a great dislike. He
never stayed there longer than he could help,
but on the first chance would rush up the stairs
and scratch, or rather I should say <i>gnaw</i> for
admittance. Speaking of this gnawing, leads me
to observe that one objection I had to receiving
him, was the fear that he would be very mischievous;
but fortunately I never found him so.
He had free access to a pantry where a variety
of eatables, usually considered dear to a rat’s
heart, were to be found; but I never knew him to
injure anything or even to cut the paper covering
of any parcel, no matter what it contained. No
doubt it was partly owing to his being so well
fed that he was not driven to theft by hunger.
I generally scattered for him on the shelves some
grains of rice or pickles of starch, and to these
he helped himself when inclined. From soap
or candles he turned away in disgust, being far
too well-bred a rat to indulge in such low tastes;
but he dearly loved a bit of plum-cake; and, shall
I confess it? he was by no means a teetotaler.
If ale was used at dinner, he would rush eagerly
about the glasses until he was supplied with some
in a spoon. I believe, before he came to us,
he had been accustomed to even stronger potations,
in which, however, we did not indulge him.</p>

<p>I have said he was not mischievous, neither was
he, as mischief among rats is generally understood;
but there is no rule without exception, and Billy
had a decided penchant for kid gloves. If any
were left carelessly about, he was sure to get hold
of them and have the fingers eaten off in a few
minutes. I cannot tell how many gloves he destroyed,
until repeated lessons of this sort enforced
more tidy habits.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention his love of music;
when he heard the piano, he would rush to the
drawing-room and spring to the performer’s knee,
where he would remain perfectly quiet, evidently
listening with much pleasure. When he first
came he was very restless, seeming to live in a
state of perpetual motion; but he soon learned
to come upon the knee to be caressed and have his
head rubbed, which operation afforded him
intense enjoyment. He would have lain in a
state of supreme delight for an hour if any one
would have rubbed his head for so long.</p>

<p>Very various were the opinions entertained of
Billy by our friends. Some of our young visitors
would ask to see him when they called, and with
them he soon became familiar, and would run
over their shoulders and about their necks quite
freely; but others had a perfect horror of him;
and I remember once, on going down to receive
two ladies, I found one of them standing on the
piano-stool in dread of his attacking her; and
no declarations as to his perfect harmlessness were
of any avail. Another time an old lady and gentleman
were spending the evening with us, and
knowing the latter to be of a very nervous temperament,
I had given strict orders that Billy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>{105}</span>
should be kept down-stairs. But Billy had no
idea of losing his tea, and managing to escape from
the servant who had him in charge, in he rushed,
as soon as the door was opened, and made straight
across the room, as usual for my knee. I gave him
a bit of cake to keep him quiet, and covered him
up with my handkerchief. ‘What’s that, what’s
that?’ exclaimed the old gentleman anxiously.
I replied as carelessly as I could: ‘Oh, it’s only
a little pet of the children’s;’ and hoped no more
notice would be taken; but presently our friend
got up, and came round to where I sat just as
Billy had finished his cake and put up his head
for more. Never shall I forget his look of dismay
as he exclaimed: ‘It’s a rat!’ while making
hasty tracks for the door. However, we succeeded
in allaying his fears; and Billy was allowed to
run about freely, with only an occasional shudder
from our friend if he approached him too closely.</p>

<p>During the spring we had a lady staying with
us who could not be reconciled to seeing a rat run
about the house, and who repelled all friendly
overtures on the part of our pet; so one morning,
out of consideration for her, Billy was banished to
another room whilst we were at breakfast; and lo!
on going into the room afterwards, I found my
friend’s ball of cotton cut into shreds, which were
piled in a little heap on the floor. It really
seemed as if he had done it from revenge, for
though I had had knitting about repeatedly, he
often rolled the balls on the carpet, but never
injured them.</p>

<p>While enough has been said, I think, to shew
that Billy was a very interesting pet, candour compels
me to admit that, like wiser and better folk,
he had his faults; and I am sorry to say his besetting
sin was jealousy. Although so thoroughly
good-tempered with all the members of our family,
he would not tolerate another pet in the house.
He had not been long with us, when he killed a
canary that had lighted on his back. At first,
there were threats of summary vengeance; but on
reflection, it was thought possible that he had been
frightened by its sudden descent upon him, and had
killed the bird in an impulse of self-defence; so
it was decided to give him the benefit of this supposition,
and he was forgiven and restored to
favour.</p>

<p>But when the midsummer holidays arrived, one
of our boys brought home a handsome young
retriever, whom it was evident from the first Billy
regarded with no friendly eye. The children of
course were much taken up with the fresh arrival;
and I presume Billy felt himself neglected, and
therefore lost no opportunity of revenging himself
upon the new favourite. It was wonderful to see
the courage of the little creature in venturing to
attack an animal so much larger than himself. If
the dog were lying quietly on the rug, he would
spring on him, and then retreat so quickly that at
first we did not know whether he had bitten him
or not, as the dog would merely utter a low growl
and retire. But one day at dinner, when our
canine friend was being supplied with pieces
which probably had formerly fallen to Billy’s
share, our little pet was so enraged, that he rushed
across the table and bit the dog on the mouth
severely. From that time his doom was sealed;
it was felt that either he or the dog must be
dismissed, and the verdict was unanimous in
favour of keeping the retriever; so Billy was tied
up in his box and sent back to his former owner.
Since then, we have occasionally heard of his
welfare; and the last news concerning him was,
that he had been taken into a garden, ‘but was
evidently too much awed by the immensity of the
universe to enjoy it.’</p>

<p class="ph3">IN TWO PARTS.</p>


<h3>PART I.—INCHGARRY’S NARRATIVE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, while upon a professional visit
at the mansion of a well-known Highland gentleman,
I was invited one morning by my host to
inspect his famous kennel of staghounds. On
that occasion, I remember well, my interest was
curiously divided between the princely animals
themselves and the magnificent specimen of humanity
who acted as their custodian. Standing
at least six feet, his finely proportioned, athletic
figure was displayed to advantage by a well-made
knickerbocker deer-stalking suit. His face was
fair, full-bearded, and strikingly regular in its
features. In the quick blue eyes gleamed the
rapidly succeeding emotions of an intelligent,
proud, sensitive nature. I observed that he
usually addressed the chief by the name of the
estate (a practice by no means uncommon in
some parts of Scotland), and that the word
‘sir’ was somewhat infrequent in his speech.
There was nothing decidedly disrespectful or
assumptive in his manner, yet it was quite
unlike that of modern inferiors towards superiors
generally. I had been so struck during our
inspection of the kennels with his appearance and
bearing, that on our return to Inchgarry Hall,
I put several questions to my worthy host respecting
him. The result of these was, that after
informing me that the young fellow’s name was
Donald Stewart, and that he was a native of
Badenoch, he entered upon the following curious
and instructive narrative of his first settlement
at Inchgarry, and of the tragedy in which it
eventuated; pointing out as he did so, with great
frankness, the evils a landlord may create among
his people by delegating too largely to an inferior
the personal supervision of his interests.</p>

<p>James Forbes, the son of one of the chief’s
humblest dependants, had been reared upon the
estate. Industry, a certain versatility of talent,
and above all, an uncompromising yet judicious
sycophancy, had together stood him in such good
stead that, beginning his career as stable-boy,
he had passed rapidly to assistant-gardener, head-gardener,
and manager of the home-farm; until,
at the time the events we are about to record took
place, he was his master’s factotum, holding the
position and title of sub-factor to the property.
Residing for three parts of the year in London or
abroad, Inchgarry necessarily gave him large
powers in matters affecting his tenantry and
servants; so that—the factorship proper being
then in the hands of an estimable but old and
infirm lawyer, with whom the wily Forbes had
ingratiated himself—the authority of the latter
was almost boundless. Like all sycophants, he
was also a tyrant. The tenantry, who held their
farms on long leases, and were practically part
and parcel of the soil, escaped the oppression
to which, under other circumstances, they might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>{106}</span>
have been subjected. Nevertheless, Forbes contrived
in many ways to harass and annoy all who
in any way offended him. As for the immediate
servants of the Hall and home-farm, the foresters
and keepers, the labourers and handicraftsmen on
the estate, his was to them strictly a reign of
terror. None but those who chose to do so by
abject flattery and toadyism dared hope to escape
molestation.</p>

<p>Among those trucklers to whom Forbes extended
his patronage, was one John Sutherland—or Ian Dhu,
as he was invariably styled—the
idlest and most worthless character in the
district. It would be difficult to conceive what
bond could exist between this semi-pariah, poacher,
and vagabond, and the chief’s confidential agent,
did we not remember that men of the sub-factor’s
stamp invariably make a henchman of
some unscrupulous master of their own weapon—sycophancy.
Ian Dhu had not only the skill to
step into the good-will of Forbes by his fawning,
but to establish himself therein by acting as spy
and reporter upon all that was said and done upon
the estate. Following no recognised employment,
though ostensibly odd-man about his patron’s
private grounds, he perverted his leisure by
haunting the garden, workshops, bothies, the
keepers’ houses, and the kitchen of the Hall itself,
picking up scraps of information for the jealous
ear of the sub-factor. He was, in fact, a necessity
of the pernicious system of control which reigned;
and he was, at the time our story commences, in
the full light of favouritism.</p>

<p>Inchgarry, my host, was a just, large-hearted, and
clear-headed man; of rather an indolent disposition
no doubt, but, when roused to interest, both
prompt and strong-willed, brooking neither argument
nor persuasion. His brief occasional visits to
the Hall were always marked by some change in,
or reversal of, his agent’s arrangements, as well
as by some considerate extension of privileges
to his ‘people.’ In one instance his wrath had
been awakened by the neglected condition of his
garden and kennels; the latter perhaps his dearest
subject of pride. He spoke sharply and conclusively
about these matters to Forbes, whose
minions both the head-gardener and chief-keeper
were. Ten days thereafter he announced that he
had engaged a man from the Lothians to superintend
his garden-grounds, and a gamekeeper from
Badenoch to supplant the inefficient favourite;
adding, however, with characteristic kindness, that
the superseded men might remain, if they chose,
as second-hands until they could better themselves.
Forbes received the news of these innovations with
outward deference and submission, but inward
chagrin and rage. It was the beginning of the
end, as it proved.</p>

<p>Archie Guthrie, the new gardener, arrived first
on the scene to form a nine days’ subject of comment
to the simple population of Inchgarry; and a few
weeks later Donald Stewart took possession of the
roomy and comfortable keeper’s cottage so picturesquely
situated by the loch side. He was accompanied
by his sister, a few years his junior, who
undertook to act as his housekeeper, and by a
powerful-looking young serving-lass. Effie was as
unlike her brother as well could be. She was
<i>petite</i>, of slight frame, with small delicate features.
Lithe, active, elfish, her dark hair and pale face,
together with the general grace and rapidity of her
movements, soon acquired for her the pretty
sobriquet of <i>sheach</i> or fairy. Cheerful, even
volatile, this singular creature had yet a depth of
tenderness and sympathy so easily stirred, so
sensitive and all-pervading, that nothing animate
appeared to escape its influence. In character, then,
as well as in appearance, she presented a marked
contrast to her handsome, really good-hearted, but
choleric and somewhat imperious brother. Yet
never perhaps, the chief informed me, was brotherly
and sisterly affection more complete and perfect
than between these two. In a short time they
had finished their new domestic arrangements, and
passed through the usual ordeal of rustic criticism.
Effie glided at once into the respect and confidence
of every woman on the estate—a feat which the
student of womankind will consider an all but
impossible one. Her kind-heartedness and tact,
doubtless, were the means towards such a result,
aided as they were by the incessant and impartial
distribution of favours, which her deft fingers and
clever little head enabled her to do with an expenditure
of nothing more than her redundant good-will
and energy. The other sex became her slaves
to a man. Every one within a radius of ten miles
in that sparsely peopled district came under the
spell of the <i>sheach</i>, and loved or admired her
secretly or openly, platonically or otherwise, according
to temperament or position. Inchgarry
gave some most amusing instances of her sway:
of stalwart Highlanders seized by the ear and
marched off to perform some menial duty, or commanded
to execute some commission for herself or
neighbours. It was said that even Forbes himself,
surly as he was, and imbittered from the
first against her brother, could never disguise the
pleasure which Effie’s presence gave him: probably
the most harmless and respectable sentiment
he ever entertained. He refused nothing
<i>she</i> asked for herself or others, and did not hesitate
to proclaim his high opinion of her disposition
and character. I record this with pleasure as the
one bright spot redeeming a dark and contemptible
nature.</p>

<p>Forbes and Stewart instinctively regarded each
other as enemies from the first. Frank and open
to a fault, the new keeper chafed under the reticence
and duplicity of the sub-factor; and to every
unreasonable command he returned a hot and indignant
refusal; to every malicious word an angry,
contemptuous retort. Thoroughly acquainted with
his own duties, he would brook no interference;
and to Forbes’s utter confusion, on one occasion,
when that worthy had attempted to meddle in
some matter affecting the dogs, he boldly threatened,
in presence of several underlings, to report
him to Inchgarry for obstructing his work. Before
two months had passed, it was war to the knife
between them. As was natural, the majority of
the natives secretly rejoiced to find that the young
stranger meant to beard the tyrant; while the great
man’s favourites and the constitutionally envious
nursed a bitter enmity against him as an interloper.
The despotism was now broken up into two
struggling factions; and the contest was a protracted
and unhappy one.</p>

<p>But more fierce and implacable even than Forbes’s
hatred of the keeper was that conceived by his
henchman, Ian Dhu. To the keenness of partisanship
he added a violent personal animosity, which
only ended with the tragic event hereafter detailed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>{107}</span>
Ian had long been suspected of deer-poaching;
but hitherto the friendship of the sub-factor had
screened him from conviction if not from detection.
At last Stewart caught him red-handed in
the act of ‘gralloching’ a stag in one of the favourite
‘passes’ of the forest. He reported the fact at
once to Inchgarry, who, if not exactly claiming his
ancestral power of ‘pit and gallows,’ reserved to
himself the right of deciding whether or not any
of his ‘people’ should be handed over to the civil
authorities. His decision was a most merciful one—merely
requiring Sutherland to surrender his
gun to the keeper. The sentence nevertheless
rankled with deadly purpose in his heart; and
but for one singular circumstance, would doubtless
have earlier taken the form of the terrible revenge
he ultimately sought.</p>

<p>That circumstance was his love for Effie
Stewart. He too had been smitten by the
<i>sheach’s</i> bewitching face and smile—smitten as
only such dark, troublous natures can be smitten.
His love was to him a terrible torture. The
better thoughts which this new and powerful
passion awakened, only goaded and stabbed, being
too intermittent to subdue the darker passions
which they illumined. From the moment he first
saw Effie, a marked change came over him, or,
more properly speaking, his idiosyncrasies became
intensified. Always taciturn, he was now morose
and brooding; his surliness became vehement
irascibility, and his roving stealthy movements
were now erratic and purposeless. He would hang
for hours around the kennels, pass and repass the
keeper’s cottage a dozen times a day, inventing
trifling excuses for calling there, that he might
look upon the girl whose unconscious influence
had so strongly affected him. In her presence his
misery was complete. He would crouch on a
settle by the fireside, silent and burning with the
unquenchable fire within him, his furtive impassioned
glances following her every movement, as
Effie flitted about the house. Whenever the little
woman paused from her work, and with piquant,
gracious vivacity addressed some pleasant remark
to him, the heavy brows would unbend, and the
dark eyes lift themselves to her face with a
transient gleam of supreme pleasure, only to be
averted again in increased gloom and depression.
On those occasions when the young neighbours
extemporised a merry-making at one or other of
their houses, or, as was oftener the case, in the
roomy cottage of the keeper, Ian Dhu’s torture
was beyond description. There he was compelled
to witness the object of his infatuation surrounded
by a number of youths, many of whom he instinctively
knew were fascinated by her. He listened
entranced when she sung—but, then, other ears
also drank in the sweet sounds; he watched the
slight elfish figure move in the merry dance, but
was she not observed with admiration by every
one? First one and then another of the strapping
young Highlanders became her partner, would
hold her hands, clasp her waist, and whirl with her
in the freedom of the old-fashioned reels; every
incident adding a fresh torment to the jealous
heart of Ian Dhu.</p>

<p>Time went on, and Ian Dhu was thus fain to
curb the rebellious desire for revenge upon
Donald Stewart. The gratification of looking
upon Effie was only possible under conditions
which his revenge would entirely destroy. Like
a hungry spaniel, he crouched and fawned when
he would otherwise have snapped. He submitted
to obey many overbearing behests of the
haughty young keeper, to assist him about the
croft or go on messages; and acted generally so as
to gain Stewart’s tolerance, if not his confidence.
These tactics were not unobserved by Forbes, who,
however, satisfied of the genuineness of the hatred
with which his henchman viewed Donald, for a
time attributed them to crafty zeal in his own
service.</p>

<p>As for the sub-factor himself, time only increased
his detestation of the keeper. Inchgarry was in
London attending to his parliamentary duties;
and Forbes did not neglect the opportunity of
wreaking his malice in every possible way upon
his proud-spirited subordinate. In his letters
to the chief, the sub-factor conveyed many hints
derogatory to Stewart, and succeeded to some
extent in his unworthy purpose.</p>

<p>The young man, who was not only conscious of
his abilities, but enthusiastic in his desire to acquit
himself creditably in all that concerned his craft,
one morning received a cold sharp letter from
Inchgarry, recounting a charge of permitting
poaching in the forest, and commenting severely
upon his negligence. The chief circumstantially
stated that the interior portions of a deer had been
found in a ‘pass’ through a certain hill, where
it had been ‘gralloched.’ The astonishment of
Stewart was for the moment fully equal to his
chagrin. He had had that very pass carefully
watched by the under-keepers, and especially by
his favourite and friend, a young sandy-haired
blue-eyed lad from Lochaber, whose surname of
Grant had been familiarised, in Highland fashion,
into ‘Grantoch’ on account of his popularity.
After the first burst of angry surprise, Stewart
sought Grantoch, who in his laconic way repudiated
the possibility of the thing, and after a deliberate
study of the subject, as he leant upon his gun,
quietly delivered himself of his opinion. About
ten days previous, he said, while cutting open
a hind, which in accordance with orders he had
shot for the dogs, Ian Dhu had been present.
Chancing to return to the same place about half
an hour later in search of the knife which he
had dropped, he was not a little surprised to
find the refuse portions removed; and was completely
puzzled when he observed, by the traces
of blood amongst the heather, that they had evidently
been carried up the forest. He was certain
now that Sutherland had, with the connivance of
Forbes, taken this method of throwing suspicion
of negligence upon Stewart. The head-keeper’s
quick intelligence grasped the whole affair before
Grantoch had finished. He directed his assistant
to state the facts as they were, in a letter to the
chief; and wrote himself a respectful but firm
repudiation of the charge. The effect was this:
Forbes received a freezing order from Inchgarry
to turn Ian Dhu out of his service. Nothing
further was said; no reflection made as to his
possible complicity in a design to injure the
keeper’s character.</p>

<p>But the incident had rendered the sub-factor’s
desire for revenge incontrollable. He goaded on
his discharged henchman to be the instrument of
wreaking their common hatred on the keeper.
To his surprise, Ian Dhu was sullenly intractable.
Forbes was at first furious, but incidentally learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>{108}</span>
the obstacle which existed in Sutherland’s
passion for Effie Stewart, he resolved to use this
as the very means of bringing him round to his
purpose. He had heard, amongst other gossip,
that Archie Guthrie’s attentions to the girl
were received with favour. Ian was now completely
under his control, and accident unfortunately
favoured the factor in working upon his
jealousy. Returning home from a visit to the
post-town one evening in his dog-cart, Forbes
observed, on a part of the road near Stewart’s
cottage, the lovers standing together arm-in-arm,
in the moonlight, evidently transacting a
lengthened and agreeable parting for the night.
Ian, whom he still sheltered, was waiting his arrival
and assisted him to alight. With a malignance
worthy of the worst part of his evil nature, he
immediately despatched the unsuspecting Sutherland
upon a message which should take him past
the spot where Archie and Effie were standing.
The effect was terrible. Ian Dhu on reaching the
place discovered the pair in the act of embracing;
staggering for a moment as if shot, he fled from
the spot and disappeared, to return, after several
weeks, to consummate the tragedy which forms
the sequel of the tale.</p>


<h3>PART II.—INCHGARRY’S NARRATIVE CONTINUED.</h3>

<p>Three weeks elapsed, during which no one in
Inchgarry had set eyes on Ian Dhu. The story of
his love for the <i>sheach</i> was commonly known, and
speculation was rife as to his proceedings since
the night of his disappearance. This was set at
rest one evening by his sudden appearance in the
kitchen of the sub-factor’s house, lean and gaunt
as a famished hound. His face was haggard and
hunger-pinched, and a gleam very like insanity
lit up the dark scowling eyes. His hair and
beard were matted and tangled, and his clothes
were soiled and rent. It was conjectured that
he had spent the interval since his flight, in the
fastnesses of the mountains—a prey to the throes
of that passion which his powerful nature had
conceived. What a picture might not imagination
draw of the terrible human struggle
enacted in those solitudes! Perhaps some such
thought occurred to the frightened women-servants
as Ian stood before them. At anyrate,
they received him with silent sympathy, and
invited him to take refreshment. It does seem
strange that the revenge which succeeded his
paroxysm of disappointed love should not first
have been directed against the young gardener and
his sweetheart. Various theories exist to account
for this; one being that it really was his purpose
to include them among his victims. My informant,
however, held the very plausible opinion that Ian
Dhu’s reason had given way under the great strain
on his feelings, that his love was thereafter mercifully
a blank to him, while the old grudge against
Stewart had assumed unnatural proportions.</p>

<p>Forbes had an interview that night in his own
parlour with his quondam henchman as the
investigation which afterwards took place proved;
and it was late when Ian Dhu slunk from the
house by the private door, carrying with him a
gun, and was seen to disappear in the belt of firs
that skirts the loch. It is mentioned, with that
morbid zest for details which a tragedy never
fails to excite, that only a few minutes previous
to Ian’s plunging into the wood, Archie Guthrie
and Effie Stewart (now formally betrothed) had
passed the sub-factor’s house arm-in-arm. What
would have been the consequences of a <i>rencontre</i>
between the lovers and Black Sutherland is a
favourite topic for surmise amongst the people of
Inchgarry to this day.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Grantoch, who had
returned from his rounds, took his spy-glass from
its case and directed it towards Bhein à B’huachaill.
A fire in the heather on this hill had been reported
earlier, and Stewart had gone to investigate the
cause, telling Grantoch to follow him when his
other duties should leave him at liberty. The burning
of the heather in the month of July, and in the
centre of the ‘forest’ ground, was a serious matter
in the eyes of the keepers, driving the deer as it
would, from a favourite haunt. Grantoch now
desired to make out, if possible, in what direction
Stewart had gone, that he might be able to join
him by the shortest route. He brought the glass
to bear on every part of the mountain, its wood-clad
base, purple sides, gray scaurs, and shimmering
water-courses—but without result; and was
just about to close it, when his glance rested upon
a human figure shewing on the near shoulder of
Bhein à B’huachaill. His practised eye told him
at once it was not Donald Stewart. He carefully
scrutinised it for some minutes, until with startled
surprise he recognised Ian Dhu creeping over the
watershed, bearing a gun on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Grantoch quietly shut his glass, returned it to
its case, examined with professional caution the
lock of his double-barrel to see that it was at half-cock,
and started at a swinging trot for the foot of
the hill. Its nearest point was only a mile and
a half distant; but, convinced that Ian was on
another poaching expedition, he resolved to get
the assistance of a keeper whose cottage stood
about a mile farther up the loch. Here he was
agreeably surprised to find Stewart engaged in
issuing some orders. The latter explained that he
had come direct to the cottage to learn whether
the under-keeper knew anything of the fire; and
that he found he had visited the spot. It was
merely a patch which had soon burned out of itself,
and Stewart had therefore waited leisurely for
his comrade’s appearance. He pricked up his ears,
however, when Grantoch told him of Ian Dhu’s
movements, at once suspecting him of having
intentionally fired the heather. The thought
brought his hasty temper to such a heat that he
resolved at once to clear up the matter by giving
chase to Ian Dhu.</p>

<p>The trio took the route which Grantoch had seen
Sutherland take, and their keen eyes kept them
close on his track after it quitted the watershed.
At length they came in full view of him as he
now strode rapidly along the side of the hill.
Their object was to detect him in the act of
poaching, confident that Inchgarry would this
time prosecute, and hopeful that the incendiarism
would also be brought home to him. To avoid
being observed in their turn, they now crouched
along amongst the tall heather, till within a
few hundred yards of where they had seen Ian
Dhu last halt. Stewart then proposed to advance
alone on all-fours to reconnoitre. As he thus
cautiously approached the poacher, he observed
that he had leapt into the dry channel of what is
termed a winter stream, and was looking along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>{109}</span>
the barrel of his weapon—a rifle—which he held
resting on the bank at the opposite side of the
channel to that on which Stewart now lay. Ian
Dhu’s face was if possible more haggard and wild
than ever, while the hand which grasped the rifle
shook as if with ague or palsy. His glance was
directed towards a spot some hundred yards distant,
where the heather shewed blackened as if by
recent fire. Now and again the maniac—for he
had every appearance of being bereft of reason—would
start up with an impatient cry and gesture,
as though disappointed by the non-appearance of
some object for which he waited. At last, in view
of the puzzled and somewhat terrified keeper, he
brought the rifle to his shoulder, and with steady
deliberate aim, fired at an object unseen by the
keeper. The echoes which the sharp report
awakened were mingled with a piercing cry!</p>

<p>Ian Dhu had not time to complete his attempted
spring from the channel of the stream before
his shoulder was seized in the strong grasp of
Donald Stewart. He turned to face his captor;
then with a scream of terror, which for the moment
paralysed the stout-hearted keeper, tore himself
free and dashed down the mountain like a hunted
stag. Donald, with the two under-keepers, who
had rapidly approached, watched him in silence as
he sped from rock to rock. Pursuit was useless.
Following him with their eyes as he disappeared
and reappeared among the inequalities of the
ground, they at last observed, with a thrill of
horror, that he did not turn aside in his descent
from a well-known point at which the hill sloped
almost precipitously for several hundred feet.
With blanched faces and upraised hands they saw
Ian Dhu pause for a moment on the dangerous
verge, and take the awful leap.</p>

<p>The three keepers resolved at once to make a
detour to the spot where he must have fallen,
and for this purpose hastened down the shoulder
of the hill. They had not proceeded far when
Grantoch called the attention of the others to
a groaning sound proceeding from some spot
near them. Stewart believing it to be the dying
moans of a wounded stag, answered his faithful
comrade rather rudely and hurried on. His course
happily took him to the very spot where the man,
whom Ian Dhu’s last bullet had reached, lay bleeding
and apparently dying. To the horror and
amazement of all, it proved to be Forbes the sub-factor.
Stewart, with a sensitiveness that did him
credit, left the wounded man in the charge of
Grantoch and their companion, and hurried off
himself to procure assistance. With as much speed
as the task would admit, he returned to the spot,
leading a sure-footed pony, and on this, supported
alternately by the keepers, Forbes was conveyed
by easy stages to his own house.</p>

<p>The wound proved mortal; but before his death
he made a statement which threw light upon
the mysterious events of that fatal morning.
Along with Ian Dhu he had concocted a scheme
for Stewart’s destruction. He it was who had
instructed Sutherland to fire the heather, calculating
shrewdly that the circumstance would
unfailingly call the keeper to the spot, in all
likelihood alone, his trusty assistant being fully
employed at that early hour. Ian, lying in wait
with Forbes’s rifle, was to have shot the head-keeper
whenever he appeared on the scene. The
explanation of his own unfortunate presence was
extremely simple. When he believed the dark
deed accomplished, he had become anxious to
recover the rifle from Ian Dhu, seeing that, in
the event of capture, its possession would open
up a suspicious inquiry respecting his own share
in the dastardly business. This motive sealed his
own fate. The impatient and vengeful Ian
had not paused to reckon the chances of a mistake,
but had pressed the trigger the moment
he saw a human figure moving through the high
heather towards the scene of the fire. Stewart, so
happily deterred from his first purpose of visiting
the burning hill, thus escaped the doom intended
for him.</p>

<p>‘And what were the fortunes of the other characters
in your sad story?’ I asked of the chief.</p>

<p>‘Oh! You see that cottage over there with the
sweet bit of garden in front, ornamented with
rockeries and ferns? That is the home of Archie
Guthrie and his wife, <i>née</i> Effie Stewart. The fairy
scarcely deserves the name now, having lost much
of her elfish slenderness and activity, but is after
all, perhaps, a prettier heroine as the gardener’s
wife, and less dangerous to my young male subjects.
A coquette she certainly never was; but
discreet and prudent to a rare degree. I am
at a loss to divine <i>what</i> the source of her strange
power was, but am thankful she is now Mrs
Guthrie.’</p>

<p>I laughed at the naïve remark.</p>

<p>‘As for Stewart,’ continued Inchgarry, ‘he has
married well—the daughter of one of my wealthiest
tenants. Grantoch has got a chief charge on an
estate in the West Highlands, taking with him
the buxom servant whom Stewart brought from
Badenoch. So you see they are all doing well.
And for my own part, the revelations which were
made at the time of the tragedy fully awakened
me to the duty of weighing carefully the complaints
of my “people,” and of charily guarding
against too free an investiture of power over them
to an ignorant, malicious, or interested servant. I
spend more time here than formerly, and am
gratified by the increased contentment and prosperity
of those under my care. The story, you
will now perceive, though sad, is not without its
moral.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aërial</span> navigation, the faculty of locomotion
through the air, the power of soaring bird-like into
the azure fields of space, has always been tantalisingly
seductive to the human imagination. So
engrossing is the theme, that although the subject
has already been discussed from a scientific point
of view in these pages, a few additional words
about its more popular aspects may not be found
uninteresting to our readers.</p>

<p>Great, and, as it has proved, baseless anticipations
were evoked by the advent of the first
balloon. Aërostation was to disclose the secrets
of the atmospheric world, and by enabling men to
predict rains and droughts, secure by the proper
cultivation of the soil abundant and excellent
harvests. The unmanageable nature of the new
invention was not taken into account at all, nor the
fact, that although you might ascend into the air
from any point you chose, no one could predict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>{110}</span>
where or how you would descend. This charming
uncertainty still attends aërial voyages; no means
have yet been discovered of guiding the balloon in
a horizontal direction; and it is always so much at
the mercy of currents of air, that the course it will
follow is a matter of chance, and not an affair of
the aëronaut’s will or choice.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to press this unmanageable
machine into the service of science,
and with some success, although what has yet been
done is little more than a suggestion of discoveries
which may at some future time be practicable by
its aid.</p>

<p>In 1862 Mr Glaisher, author of a history of
<i>Travels in the Air</i>, made a series of ascents from
Wolverhampton, in order to verify a number of
scientific observations; the results of which are
contained in the annals of the British Association.
A new balloon was provided for him, which was
not made of silk, but of American cloth, a stronger
and more serviceable material, and in this aërial
machine he encountered sundry mishaps and misadventures,
on two occasions narrowly escaping
with his life.</p>

<p>Its very danger lends to balloon-travelling a
sense of conscious adventure, of thrilling excitement,
peculiarly its own. Added to this, the cloud-scenery
through which the aëronaut glides is not
only novel, but is often, especially at sunrise and
sunset, most gorgeously beautiful; while the earth
beneath, which seems to have motion transferred
to it, presents as it hurries past, a charming
and varied panorama. Woods and rivers, hamlets
and towns, hills and valleys, and wide-spreading
downs, succeed each other in rapid succession.
From the immense height, all idea of the comparative
altitude of objects is lost; great cities
appear like small models of towns, and the biggest
man-of-war looks like a boy’s toy ship. Morning
up in cloudland is a gloriously radiant spectacle.
The balloon floats out of darkness into
a world of shadowy mountain ranges, colourless
and unsubstantial at first, but borrowing from the
rising sun the softest, tenderest hues of roseate pink
and warmest crimson, glowing and blending and
fading away at last into a mellow flood of amber
gold.</p>

<p>In France, for some time after their invention,
balloons were quite the rage, the first made for
scientific purposes being that of July 1803, and
which was followed by several others having
for their object the solution of many physical
problems, not a few of which remain problems
still. In 1850 two ascents were made for the
purpose of investigating certain atmospheric phenomena.
One especially of these aërial voyages
was in the last degree unfortunate. Scarcely had
the two philosophers MM. Barral and Bixio taken
their seats, than they made the unpleasant discovery
that their balloon was not in good working
order; and while they were hesitating about what
should be done in the circumstances, a violent gust
of wind settled the question for them, and the
balloon, blown from the earth, shot into the air
with the velocity of an arrow. Becoming rapidly
inflated, the machine then bulged out at top and
bottom, covering the car like a hood, and enveloping
the unfortunate aëronauts in total darkness.
‘Their position was most critical; and when one of
them endeavoured to secure the valve-rope, a rent
was made in the lower part of the balloon, and the
hydrogen gas with which it was inflated escaping
close to their faces suffocated both of them, causing
a momentary exhaustion, followed by nausea and
violent vomiting.’</p>

<p>In this helpless condition they discovered that
they were descending rapidly; and on groping
about for the cause they found that the balloon
was split open in the middle, and that there was a
rent in it two yards long. This was a cruel predicament
in which to find themselves thirty thousand
feet up in the air, and very naturally they
abandoned all hope of life, although, like wise
men, they did all in their power to preserve it.
To lessen the downward velocity of the balloon
they threw overboard all their ballast, then article
after article of their raiment even to their fur
coats, preserving only their instruments, with
which they at last descended in safety in a vineyard
near Lagny.</p>

<p>The motion in a balloon is scarcely perceptible.
You are not conscious of rising; but the earth
appears to recede from you, and to advance to
meet you during a descent. In the higher regions
of the air, the intense solitude of the cloud-scape
has something in it awful and oppressive, as if
the world were left behind for ever, and the aëronaut
were about to launch chance-driven into the
vast infinitude of shadowland. Amid these altitudes,
if any sound is made by the aëronaut, it is
echoed back in ghostly tones by the vast envelope
of the balloon, which as it floats casts a shadow
sometimes black and sometimes white; but which
is usually surrounded by an aureole or halo more
or less distinctly marked.</p>

<p>In throwing out ballast or any small article
from a balloon, a certain degree of caution is
requisite, as a bottle or any similar object falls
with such velocity that if it were to strike the roof
of a cottage it would go right through it. We
are told that Gay-Lussac, in an ascent in 1804,
threw out a common deal chair from the height of
23,000 feet. It fell beside a country girl who was
tending some sheep in a field, and as the balloon
was invisible, she concluded—and so did wiser
heads than hers—that the chair had fallen straight
down from heaven, a gift of the Virgin to her
faithful followers. No one was sceptical enough
to deny it, for there was the chair, or rather its
remains. The most the incredulous could venture
to do was to criticise the coarse workmanship of
the miraculous seat, and they were busy carping
and fault-finding with the celestial upholstery,
when an account of M. Gay-Lussac’s aërial voyage
was published, and extinguished at once the discussion
and the miracle.</p>

<p>In 1868 M. Tissandier and a professional
aëronaut made a voyage over the North Sea in a
balloon called the Neptune. The machine made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>{111}</span>
a splendid ascent, and was soon floating in mid air
buoyant as a feather at the height of four thousand
feet, bound, as the aëronauts fondly hoped,
for the coast of England. But in this they soon
found that they had counted without their host;
the Neptune, impelled by the wind, was soaring
away in the direction of the middle of the German
Ocean. This most inauspicious goal struck terror
for a few moments into their ardent souls; but
they were soon reassured by observing that the
wind in the atmospheric regions below them was
setting towards the shore, and that by sinking into
this lower current of air they could return whenever
they chose. Thus yielding to the current of
their fate, they allowed themselves to be carried
out to sea, floating like gossamer into the very
heart of cloudland. Gorgeous scenes, more splendid,
more airy, more delicate than the most glowing
visions of the Arabian Nights, rose around them.
It was like the enchantment of a vivid dream.
They took no note of time; every sense was
absorbed in that of vision; they even forgot to be
hungry, but gazed, and gazed, and gazed again
upon the wide waste of waters that spread beneath
them, glowing like one vast molten emerald;
its glories half seen, half hid by the multitude of
cloud mountains and valleys that rose fluctuating
and fantastic on every side, fair with luminous
half-lights, delicately lovely with pearly iridescence
shading into silvery gray. Thus hovering miles
above the world and its commonplace cares, they
enjoyed an interval of transcendent delight, rudely
broken in upon by the professional aëronaut, a
creature of appetite, who pulled the valve-rope
unbidden, thus causing them to descend from
their cloudy paradise into the grosser atmosphere
that immediately surrounds the earth, where
they at length bethought themselves—of lunch.
In spite of thick thronging poetic fancies and
transcendental raptures, they made a very tolerable
repast, M. Tissandier finishing his portion
of the fowl by tossing a well-picked drumstick
overboard. For this imprudence the professional
was down upon him immediately. ‘Do
you not know,’ quoth he, ‘that to throw out
ballast without orders is a very serious crime in a
balloon?’ M. Tissandier was at first inclined to
argue the point; but on consulting the sensitive
barometer he was fain to admit that in consequence
of the disappearance of the chicken-bone, the
Neptune had made an upward bound of between
twenty and thirty yards. Very fine calculation—if
true.</p>

<p>Luncheon satisfactorily over, they again soared
upward out of sight and sound of earth, and soon
found themselves once more in their cloudy
Elysium, but with a change; mist and fog hemmed
them round instead of the breeze and sunshine,
but did not make them less happy. The Neptune
was to them a little Goshen, a lonely floating
temple of peace, dedicated to contentment and
ease. The serenity of their souls was depicted in
their faces. Tranquil and easy, they took no
thought of the morrow, no, nor of the next hour,
when suddenly there broke upon their ears, like a
faint far-distant murmur, a sound subdued, monotonous,
and yet terrible. Was it the voices of the
spheres? No, gentle reader; it was a strain more
awful still—it was the voice of the sea. In a
moment the listless ease, the sweet do-nothingness
of those idlers in cloudland was gone, clean washed
away by the swish and swell of that intrusive
ocean, which stretched beneath them, painted by
the sunset with a thousand glowing tints of
beauty, which they had neither leisure nor tranquillity
to admire. Fortunately the wind was
setting inshore; and amid the fast falling shades of
night, the anxious aëronauts were fortunate enough
to descry a cape crowned with a lighthouse. Every
nerve was strained to reach it; and after a few
moments of intense anxiety and effort, the anchor
was let go. It caught in a sandhill, and the
Neptune once more moored to earth, rolled over on
its side, and was after some difficulty secured.</p>

<p>The spot where they landed was curiously
enough only a few yards from the reef of rocks
where the first aëronaut, Pilatre de Rosier, was
dashed to pieces in 1785.</p>

<p>Sometimes, like other bubbles, the balloon
bursts; and when this little accident happens, say
four thousand feet up in the air, it is of course
attended with unpleasant and inconvenient consequences,
as was the experience of MM. Fonvielle
and Tissandier, who with a party of nine made
an ascent in a veteran balloon called ‘the Giant.’
Merry as larks they soared into the air, keenly
enjoying the beauty of the day, the novelty of the
pastime, the sense of liberty, of entire freedom
from all wonted conventionalisms or accustomed
restraints. Then with what a keen school-boy
edge of appetite they fell upon their chicken,
which seems the appropriate food for balloons,
eaten from newspapers, which served as plates,
and washed down with soda-water and Bordeaux.
Champagne was inadmissible; an unruly cork
might have popped unawares through the silken
tissues of the envelope, and thus hastened
a catastrophe. But let us not anticipate. The
banquet was over, the board, that is to say the
newspapers were cleared, and ‘the feast of reason
and the flow of soul’ had begun. All was bright
airy genial cordiality and mirth, when suddenly
the attention of the travellers was attracted to a
white smoke issuing from the sides of the balloon.
Whence came this ominous mist, this preternatural
cloud, that began to enshroud them? One reckless
youth said: ‘It is the Giant smoking his pipe.’
And so it was with a vengeance! Then followed
a few terrible moments, in which each after his
own fashion bade the world farewell, and found it
marvellous hard to do so. The clouds, the sky, the
pleasant sunlight, was that their last look at each?
It seemed so; but while they were still shivering
dizzy and aghast upon that awful threshold, the
balloon fell, and strange to relate, fell safely, and
they were saved.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Monsieur Tissandier made
another ascent in the Neptune with Monsieur de
Fonvielle, and they were busily engaged conducting
some scientific experiments when a sharp crack
like a sudden quick peal of thunder fell upon their
astounded ears, and the professional aëronaut
exclaimed in a loud startled voice: ‘The balloon
has burst!’ What followed, we give in Monsieur
Tissandier’s own words: ‘It was too true; the
Neptune’s side was torn open and transformed
suddenly into a bundle of shreds, flattening down
upon the opposite half. Its appearance was now
that of a disc surrounded with a fringe! We
came to the ground immediately. The shock was
awful. The aëronaut disappeared. I leaped into
the hoop, which at that instant fell upon me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>{112}</span>
together with the remains of the balloon and all
the contents of the car. All was darkness. I felt
myself rolled along the ground, and wondered if I
had lost my sight, or if we were buried in some
hole or cavern. An instant of quiet ensued, and
then the loud voice of the aëronaut was heard
exclaiming: “Now come all of you from under
there.”’ And one after another they emerged
unhurt into the sunshine, in time to bid farewell
to a few fragments of the balloon which were
floating away upon the rising wind.</p>

<p>Such experiences must as a rule be trying to the
nerves of most people, and we must be so plain as
say that travelling by balloon is at best an act of
extreme danger and temerity. In order to utilise
balloons, it is evident that some sure means of
guiding them must be invented; and this discovery
or anything approaching to it has yet to
be made. In fact, a balloon is still, after about a
hundred years’ experience, little better than a toy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LIGHTNING-CONDUCTORS">LIGHTNING-CONDUCTORS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of our readers may have wondered why tall
buildings such as church steeples and factory
chimneys are provided with thin rods of iron
running down their sides; and may have been at
a loss to understand their meaning. Their use is
to conduct lightning harmlessly to the ground
during thunder-storms. We have, however, had
warnings enough that a bad lightning-conductor
is worse, as regards the security of the building
it is supposed to protect, than none at all. Unless
the electrical connection with the earth be perfect,
the conductor may invite the very danger which it
ought to turn aside. Rusted chains, imperfect
fittings, and the absence of a sufficient thickness
of untarnished metal, are responsible for much
mischief. Lightning, properly dealt with, is
robbed of much of its terrific power; but when
its natural path is blocked, and its swift circuit
interrupted, it inevitably rends and tears and
burns, scathing and scattering all substances before
its resistless might.</p>

<p>Franklin meant the lightning-conductors which
he invented to consist of iron alone. Iron, however,
has too strong an affinity for oxygen to allow
of this. All moisture, and all heat, corrode it
more or less; and thus grew up the custom of
pointing the conductors with copper, and in some
cases with costly platinum, soldered to the iron
rod. But exposure to weather, and the weak
galvanic currents which unavoidably set in where
metal of one sort is in contact with metal
of another sort, cause rapid decomposition at the
joint, and encourage the rust to eat into the substance
of the rod. A heavy flash will melt or
cripple a conductor thus imperfect, and then woe
to the structure! This defect can now be cured
by coating the iron rod completely with nickel,
a metal which defies rust, and which conducts
electricity better than the pure iron does. Bars
and rods of this nickelised iron have been kept
under water for several days without tarnishing,
and resist the effects of the most powerful battery
of Leyden jars.</p>

<p>It had been believed, until lately, that platinum
was a metal with which no rogue, however
dexterous, could tamper. The platinum coinage of
the Russia of thirty years since was considered
un-imitable by the manufacturers of false money;
while the capsules, crucibles, and other apparatus
required by scientific men were sold according to
the high market value of what is really a precious
metal. Unluckily, fraud has been found possible
even in this case. The Director of the Royal
Italian Observatory on Vesuvius, M. de Luca, surprised
at finding first one and then another of
the platinum points of his conductors melted by
the effect of lightning, made a careful investigation,
and discovered that the platinum had been
adulterated with from ten to twelve per cent. of
lead, and thus rendered fusible. Platinum thus
mixed with an inferior metal can be identified by
its lesser density, or more easily by the blowpipe,
before which a tell-tale green flame will reveal
the presence of the lead. Such a mixture would
render the hitherto resisting platinum absolutely
worthless in the laboratory.</p>
